### For nursing students

IvDrop assists nursing students to calculate drip rate and flow rate for IV injection for their practices. With IvDrop, students can calculate accurate infusion rate to practice on dummies or IV training arms.

For your reference, the Flow rate(mL/hr) formula is as follows:

</div>

Using IvDrop is more convenient than using general calculators, since it gives more accurate results in a simpler, faster way.

Students can schedule a reminder and save history when it’s necessary. IvDrop also provides a virtual drip chamber so that students can compare and check the training arms. IvDrop will be of a great help for nursing students who want to develop their performances and skill sets.

IvDrop is available for various units and types of chambers. The input field is adjusted automatically based on the unit that you use. You can manage and adjust each field either as a whole or as a part.

You can also save frequently-used units and settings, as well as the results.

<div class="column" markdown=1>
When necessary, IvDrop can send you a reminder based on the amount of fluid that’s left in each fluid bag. You can check IV bags are either 3/4 full or 1/4 full.

You can also save certain data to search later or reuse it whenever you need.

<h3>Virtual chamber</h3>
<div class="flex">
<div class="column" markdown=1>
For gravity infusion, IvDrop provides a virtual drip chamber that simulates drip rate. You can see the virtual chamber by part of the ‘Check’ section.

You can either simulate the drip rate that’s calculated, or check the current drip rate of the actual chamber.
