We are committed to protecting your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously, and we don’t share your data with anyone.

### We does not collect any personal information

When you first install the app, we may automatically have access to your device information (such as operating system version, preferences, etc). But those data are not stored anywhere. None of your personal data stored in the app is accessible to us and you can delete it at any time by removing the app.

If you use Apple’s iCloud service, you may be asked to provide personal information when logging into iCloud. But we will not have access to any of this information, either.

### Changes to our privacy notice

We may update this privacy notice without prior notice when necessary to reflect changes to our data protection practices. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us by email.
